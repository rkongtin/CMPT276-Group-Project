To Do:
    For the schools views.
        * Edit schools should have a way to look up the latitude and longitude of the address. I'm not sure if we'll need them
        * possibly pretty the thing up
        * create tests for stuff
        * allow users to only be able to view their own profile page
        
    Done:
        * allowing only admins to access the schools sections
        * admins have a way to access schools, through the bar up top
        * admins able to view all users, and then go to edit them
        * users makeAdmin page (where we'll create admins), this should only have the option to change whether they're an admin or not
        * make makeAdmin page functional, can now create admins
        * fix all the random stuff showing up above on users/index  (Deleting an equals sign in the index fixed)
        * allow users to change password
        * fix users/home, it's having errors with users show actions
