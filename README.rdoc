== README

To Do:
    For the schools views.
        * Edit schools should have a way to look up the latitude and longitude of the address. I'm not sure if we'll need them
        * possibly pretty the thing up
        * then we require a way to actually create admins (see below point)
        * users edit page (where we'll create admins), this should only have the option to change whether they're an admin or not
        * allow users to chagne password
        * create tests for stuff
        * fix all the random stuff showing up above on users/index
        * fix users/home, it's having errors with users show action
        
    Done:
        * allowing only admins to access the schools sections
        * admins have a way to access schools, through the bar up top
        * admins able to view all users, and then go to edit them
