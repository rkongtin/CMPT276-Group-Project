README

To Do:
    For the schools views.
        * Edit schools should have a way to look up the latitude and longitude of the address. I'm not sure if we'll need them
        * possibly pretty the thing up
        * create tests for stuff(Thomas)
        * allow users to change email (currently getting some error when I try, the pages are all there though)
        * give screen for users to see the details of newley created account
        * drop-down menu to select the schools(Charles)
        * make the contact information be only phone number and make the input box accepts only phone number
        * try to upload pictures for the houses by using "file.field"
        * house information page(Charles)
        * implement the house information in the window content(Yong)
        * allows users to search for a transit by using Translink API(Yong)
        * uploading images for the profile page(Yong and Rudy)
        * currently there is not use for users/edit, figure out what to do with it (or just leave it so other code references to it don't break)
        * deletion of user accounts
        * figure out how we're getting lat and long of schools
        * edit schools model to do some error checking (stuff like making sure lat and long must be decimals/doubles)
        
    Done:
        * allowing only admins to access the schools sections
        * admins have a way to access schools, through the bar up top
        * admins able to view all users, and then go to edit them
        * users makeAdmin page (where we'll create admins), this should only have the option to change whether they're an admin or not
        * make makeAdmin page functional, can now create admins
        * fix all the random stuff showing up above on users/index  (Deleting an equals sign in the index fixed)
        * allow users to change password
        * fix users/home, it's having errors with users show actions
        * allow users to only be able to view their own pages (let me know if they can still access pages they shouldn't)
        * make website not bug/crash if non-logged in user tries viewing items they shouldn't
        * admins have a way to access houses, through the bar up top
        * refactoring code(Thomas) (I believe this is all done, except for commenting of users/home which I can't do myself)
 
        
Notes:
    * Test names are designed to be self-explanatory, and are written in camel case. This allows for less commenting needed to be done.
