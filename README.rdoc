== README

To Do:
    For the schools views.
        * Edit should have a way to look up the latitude and longitude of the address. I'm not sure if we'll need them
        * possibly pretty the thing up
        * require users to log in and be admin to access the schools views (requires adding an additional thing in the users model to record if admin)
        * then we require a way to actually create admins (possibly start with 1 admin, who can create new admins who then edit their passwords)
